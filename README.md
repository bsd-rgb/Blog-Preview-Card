## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS / Flexbox

### What I learned

I have always linked fonts externally, and never used fonts from my device. I learned that it is just as easy to link local fonts as it is external. Also, at the beginning of this challenge I could not grasp the difference between `:focus` and `:active` states. [I found a great answer with an example on Stack Overflow!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1677990/what-is-the-difference-between-focus-and-active).
